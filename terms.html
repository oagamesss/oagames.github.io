If you access the Site from the European Union, Asia, or any other region of the world with laws or other requirements governing personal data collection, use, or disclosure that differ from applicable laws in the United States, then through your continued use of the Site, you are transferring your data to the United States, and you expressly consent to have your data transferred to and processed in the United States. Further, we do not knowingly accept, request, or solicit information from children or knowingly market to children. Therefore, in accordance with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, if we receive actual knowledge that anyone under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us without the requisite and verifiable parental consent, we will delete that information from the Site as quickly as is reasonably practical.</p>

    <h2>Term and Termination</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Site. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE TERMS OF USE, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION AND WITHOUT NOTICE OR LIABILITY, DENY ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SITE (INCLUDING BLOCKING CERTAIN IP ADDRESSES), TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY REASON OR FOR NO REASON, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR COVENANT CONTAINED IN THESE TERMS OF USE OR OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATION.

If we terminate or suspend your account for any reason, you are prohibited from registering and creating a new account under your name, a fake or borrowed name, or the name of any third party, even if you may be acting on behalf of the third party. In addition to terminating or suspending your account, we reserve the right to take appropriate legal action, including without limitation pursuing civil, criminal, and injunctive redress.</p>

We will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, price change, suspension, or discontinuance of the Site. We cannot guarantee the Site will be available at all times. We may experience hardware, software, or other problems or need to perform maintenance related to the Site, resulting in interruptions, delays, or errors. We reserve the right to change, revise, update, suspend, discontinue, or otherwise modify the Site at any time or for any reason without notice to you.

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Use and your use of the Site are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the State of Georgia, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>

    <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Use (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.</p>

    <p>If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). The arbitration may be conducted in person, through document submission, by phone, or online. If a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, it shall be commenced in the state and federal courts located in United States County, Georgia. The Parties agree that arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually, and not as part of any class or representative proceeding.</p>

    <p>Certain disputes, such as intellectual property claims or claims seeking injunctive relief, are excluded from these arbitration and informal negotiation requirements.</p>

    <h2>Corrections</h2>
    <p>There may be information on the Site that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions. We reserve the right to correct any errors and to update the Site content at any time without prior notice.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>THE SITE IS PROVIDED ON AN AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE BASIS. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SITE WILL BE AT YOUR SOLE RISK. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN CONNECTION WITH THE SITE AND YOUR USE THEREOF. WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE SITE’S CONTENT OR ANY SITES LINKED TO IT.</p>

    <h2>Limitations of Liability</h2>
    <p>IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFIT OR DATA, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SITE.</p>

    <h2>Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any loss or liability arising out of your use of the Site, your breach of these Terms, or your violation of any law or rights of a third party.</p>

    <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us. Our failure to enforce any right or provision shall not be a waiver. If any provision is found unenforceable, the rest remains in effect. No joint venture, employment, or agency relationship is created by your use of the Site.</p>
